* H264 features

  - Fluster score currently is 129/135 for JVT-AVC_V1.
    This probably won't improve.

* Support for HEVC and VP9 are planned for this driver.

  First, the h264 backend needs to be stabilized.

* Evaluate sharing code with rkvdec

  As rkvdec is still in staging, this driver stays there as well.
